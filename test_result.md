The homepage enhancements (advanced search, interactive features, animations) are working well. The footer appears consistently on all pages with correct social links. Particle animations are smooth. The Base64 tool improvements on the Tools page work correctly with multi-layer decoding. The Custom page has been cleaned up as requested. Navigation between pages works correctly with consistent design across all pages."

    message: "Completed verification testing of the fixes. Particles are consistent across all pages (Home, Tools, File Analysis, Custom, About) and move smoothly in the background. The Custom page shows two scripts in the Script Library: 'Demo Text Analyzer' and 'Example Tool', but 'Sample Hash Tool' was not found. The File Analysis page has a proper file upload interface with no emoji display issues above the search bars. Navigation between all pages works smoothly, and the footer with Discord link appears on all pages. Overall, the application is working correctly with the exception of the missing 'Sample Hash Tool' script."
